Thanks for checking this out!!

This hack was made as a way to answer some of my peer's most frequent complaints: that they want to bike around the city, but
don't want to store their own bike or use the bikeshare system. In urban envirnments, it's a hassle to care for and store
these huge bikes, but people are still interested in biking around town! Enter bikester! Users want a more personalized rental 
experience, similar to renting a car, while being able to save the environment, have some exercise, and benefit the community 
in the process (cut of proceeds could go to community). 

This is a civically minded application for crowdsourcing bikes, essentially allowing users to rent out their bikes on an hourly
or daily basis from the people around them.

We implemented this in iOS using a Firebase backend, which allows us to store photos of bikes, bike/user info, 
authentication, etc. until a reasonable limit without expense. 

We will continue to work on this idea after PennApps as a side project, with the end-goal being to shape how people
